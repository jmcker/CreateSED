# CreateSED #
Visual Basic macro designed to create Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) plots for Young Stellar Objects.

The macro CreateSED() sources a user data sheet, prompts for the selection of star IDs, and creates SEDs for each selected object.

The set of variables in the header contains most of the relevant values and settings.
Should anything need to be adapted or updated, reasigning these values should be relatively easy.
