# CreateSED #
Visual Basic macro designed to create Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) plots for the NITARP project "An Infrared Search for Young Stellar Objects in IC 1396." Abstract available [here](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AAS...22924111J).

The macro CreateSED() sources a user data sheet, prompts for the selection of star IDs, and creates SEDs for each selected object.

The set of variables in the header contains most of the relevant values and settings.
Should anything need to be adapted or updated, reasigning these values should be relatively easy.

### Usage ###
Please see the instructions [here](https://github.com/jmcker/CreateSED/blob/master/CreateSED_Instructions_v1.pdf).

*Note: The end of the instruction manual covers a number of commonly experienced errors.*

An example spreadsheet with the macro embedded and SEDs already produced is available [here](https://github.com/jmcker/CreateSED/blob/master/Example_Spreadsheet-12.13.xlsm)
